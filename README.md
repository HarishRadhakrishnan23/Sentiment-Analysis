# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Food Reviews

This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis** of Amazon food reviews using both traditional lexicon-based methods and advanced transformer-based models. The primary objective is to understand consumer sentiment and behavior, leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.


## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is crucial for extracting insights from customer reviews on platforms like Amazon. This project uses:
- **VADER**: A lexicon-based model for quick sentiment analysis.
- **RoBERTa**: A transformer-based model for domain-specific fine-tuning and advanced sentiment classification.

By comparing these methods, the study highlights the strengths and limitations of each approach and explores ways to combine their capabilities.
